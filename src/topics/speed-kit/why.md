# Why Speed Kit?

With Speed Kit, users of your website will experience less

## Page load time is money 
Did you know that Amazon would lose more than 1.3B USD in revenue per year, if their website became a 10th of a second slower.
It is also true for publishers, whose business model depends on a user experience that facilitates consumption of as much content as possible. 
However, many brands, publishers, and e-commerce businesses have heterogeneous and complex technology stacks that make it extremely hard to tackle performance, scalability, and page load time.
Novel browser technologies now offer a means of making web performance as simple as including a script.

Baqend has developed **Speed Kit** that directly hooks into an existing website and makes it **50-300% faster**.
Therefore, Speed Kit uses [Service Workers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers)
which come with a **browser support of > 75%** and automatically enable an **offline mode** for users of your website.
Because it **works for any website**, it is the perfect solution for Publishers, Landing Pages, E-Commerce, Brands, and Agencies.
