#  How Speed Kit Works

To accelerate content delivery, Speed Kit intercepts requests made by the browser and reroutes them: 
Instead of loading content from the original source, the browser fetches data from Baqend's fast infrastructure.  
The following schematic illustrates how Speed Kit works.

To activate Speed Kit, you simply include a code snippet into your website which we generate for you. 
Whenever a user is visiting your website, the snippet then launches the Speed Kit [**Service Worker**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API), a process running concurrently to the main thread of execution in your browser. 
As soon as the Service Worker is active, all HTTP requests matching your [speedup policies](../speed-kit/whiteblacklisting.md) (whitelist, blacklist etc.) are rerouted to Baqend. 
If we have a cached copy of the requested resource (Media, Text etc.), it is served superfast; if the resource is requested for the first time from our caches, it is served as fast as the origin allows â€“ but will be cached and fast from there on.

To avoid stale data, Speed Kit's caches have to be updated whenever your content changes. 
For this purpose, we provide a convenient the [refresh API](../speed-kit/refreshing.md) that allows you to update all caches (including the browser caches which is located on the user's device). 
This can be done both in *realtime* and in *scheduled* fashion.
